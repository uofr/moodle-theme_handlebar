THEME_Handlebar
===============

Theme_Handlebar is a child theme of Moodle's new core theme Boost.

It is built on Bootstrap4 and Mustache templates.

In addition to Boost's preset settings, Handlebar adds:

1. Presets - presets added by ftp/ssh to the theme/scss/presets folder will
be automatically added to the presets drop down, in addition to those uploaded
via the user interface.
2. Colours - additional brand colour pickers to fine tune the selected presets,
along with the standard pre/post raw scss custom settings.
3. Content - a footnote setting to add standard content into the footer space
4. Heading and images - add a page background image and a default heading background
image - the heading image can be overridden at a course level by adding an image
banner to the course summary files. A separate login page background image can also
be added.
5. Social networking icons - a panel of social icons can be created, including self-
defined icons.

Also, Handlebar is designed to utilise additional block regions - a TopBar region
which will host blocks horizontally and [COMING SOON] several block region 'pages'
which will pull out as sliders rather than occupy space on the main page.

NOTE: github MASTER is for development purposes - always use STABLE branches in production
